## üìä Game Rules

1. **Starting**: First player to create the game goes first
2. **Turns**: Players alternate placing their ID on empty cells
3. **Winning**: Complete a row, column, or diagonal with your ID
4. **Drawing**: All cells filled with no winner
5. **Invalid Moves**: 
   - Not your turn ‚Üí `NOT_YOUR_TURN` error
   - Cell occupied ‚Üí `CELL_OCCUPIED` error
   - Game ended ‚Üí `GAME_ENDED` error

## üèÜ Leaderboard

### Efficiency Metric
- **Definition**: Average moves needed to win
- **Calculation**: Total moves in wins √∑ Number of wins
- **Example**: Won 3 games with 5, 4, 6 moves = 5.0 efficiency

### Ranking Modes
1. **By Wins**: Most total victories
2. **By Efficiency**: Fewest moves per win (min 1 win required)

### Get Leaderboard
```bash
# Top 3 by wins
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/leaderboard?sort_by=wins

# Top 3 by efficiency
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/leaderboard?sort_by=efficiency
```
